# niri-config
my niri configurations -- dual monitor simple layout

`start_waybar.fish`

just handles initializing both waybars for each monitor.

power menu options have fixes for killing specific tasks so i don't have to wait through

`a stop job is runing for user manager (1s/1000000000yr)`
everytime i shutdown or reboot.
